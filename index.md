My name is Zixin Zhou, and I also go by **Jack**. I am a final-year undergrad at Turing Class, Peking University, where I am fortunate to be advised by  [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). I am also pleased to work with [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info/) and [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) during my undergraduate years.

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science with  particular interests in game theory and mechanism design, approximation algorithms, and machine learning theory.  

**I am currently applying for PhD (21Fall).**
